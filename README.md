# google_chrome_extensions

1. GSDC :
Problem statement: Google forms(configured to save data in google spreadsheet) when submitted, data is presisted in last row. Last row index maintained some where in google which is not populated while actual insertion. This leads to inconsistency if we manually(not via form) want to add data into target spreadsheet.
Solution: Some utility that takes data to be inserted manually and does form submission on behalf of human. Chrome extensions seemed to be best-fit, hence this. 

20200131 : We are able to autofill google-form-questions (short answer, multiple choice, checkboxes, drop-down, date ) of required/non-required types.
